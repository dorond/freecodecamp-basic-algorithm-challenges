# FreeCodeCamp Basic Algorithm Scripting Challenges

As part of my journey towards becoming a data scientist, I am learning Python.

In order to improve my algorithmic skills using the language, I am working through the challenges on the FreeCodeCamp platform. While they used JavaScript for their teachings, I am going to solve the same problems using Python.

I will attempt to solve these challenges using object-oriented programming (wjere applicable) and leverge test-drive development so as to create a more rounded skillset. 

The FreeCodeCamp challenges require that your code passes their tests. These test specification provide a nice framework from which to implement tests for the same problem in another language. Where possible, my test code will reflect their testing requirements.
